    <li>Added "Open in JobTracker" service (thanks, @quiiver!). Select a job id string, right click, Services -> Open in JobTracker.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are running Mavericks, Sparkle will probably hang while trying to update. If that's the case, download the latest version from <a href="http://footle.org/JobTracker">http://footle.org/JobTracker</a></p>
